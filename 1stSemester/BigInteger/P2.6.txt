P2.6
P2.6The BigInteger class represents integer numbers with an arbitrary number of digits.
(As you will see in Chapter 4, the int type cannot express very large integers.)
You can construct a BigInteger object by providing a string of its digits, such as

BigInteger a = new BigInteger("12345678987654321");

Write a program that prints the square, fourth power, and eighth power of a,
using one of the methods of the BigInteger class.
