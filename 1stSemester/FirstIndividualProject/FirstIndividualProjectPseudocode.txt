Prompt: P1.10
A television manufacturer advertises that a television set has a certain size,
measured diagonally. You wonder how the set will fit into your living room.
Write an algorithm that yields the horizontal and vertical size of the television.
Your inputs are the diagonal size and the aspect ratio.
(the ratio of width to height, usually 16 : 9 for television sets)




Ask for the measurement of the TV diagonally (d)
Ask for the aspect ratio of the TV (a:b)

l = length
w = width

l =(a * d)/(√(a^2 + b^2))
w =(b * d)/(√(a^2 + b^2))
