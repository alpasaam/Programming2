•• P4.3Write a program that reads a number from the user and does the following: Discard all but the last three digits. Reverse the digits, subtract the original from the reversed (discarding any minus sign), reverse the digits of the difference, and add the difference and the reversed difference. Then print the sum. For example:

Input: 371

Reversed: 173

Difference: 198

Reversed: 891

Sum: 1089

This procedure is sometimes called the “1089 puzzle” because the final result is 1089 in most cases.
