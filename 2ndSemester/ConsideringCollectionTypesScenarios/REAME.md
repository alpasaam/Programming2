Your HR application must contain employee id, employee name and hire date. Comparisons will need to be made to establish seniority and benefit considerations. What collection would suffice for storing each of these data types in a single element/entity and why?
Your application will need to store names of countries with their corresponding capital city (one acting as key and one as value.) Which collection will allow you to put individual entries into a collection as a key and a value and why?
Your inventory application will not allow you to store duplicate items that will need to be described by a part number and part name. The collection will always be sorted in the application by the item string text which acts as the name. Which collection would suffice and why?
Your application will deal with standard "deck of cards" logic where shuffling logic will pop a card in the collection to the top of the deck. You will also need to search for cards possibly present in any current state of a full or partial deck. Which collection could handle card logic best and why?
Your bank account application will need account objects containing account number and balance information. Which will allow you to track accounts in active or inactive states where a balance may be null?
